LinuxCNC related documentation
Please see ReadMe_J.txt to read the Japanese Readme.
The Japanese document is an M-Word file translated by Google.

For LinuxCNC_Manual_Pages.pdf, only the parts I need to understand are translated item by item. Please note that not all have been translated.

LinuxCNC_Documentation.pdf is not exactly the same structure, but it has been translated to be a serial number as Chapter. Since the size of a Word file is large, if you use the navigation window (View tab-> Display panel-> Navigation window) when opening it in Word, the "Heading" will be displayed and it will be easier to handle.
